Rails-based Portfolio Application

Hosted at http://www.nicholascase.net, this is the git repository for my developer profile site. It's built using Rails 4.0.0 and Ruby 2.0.0-p353. The backend for this app is not as intense as most of the other apps in my GitHub repositories, but it just goes to show that Rails can be used to very quickly go from idea to production to deployment. Case in point, this app took about three hours to write from scratch. Send me a message if you have any questions.
